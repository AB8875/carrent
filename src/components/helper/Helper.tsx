SSL is an encryption technology used to protect transmissions between Users and Carent server. SSL works by encrypting data that has been inputted by Users and transferred from Users toCarent server and retransmissions of data for confirmation from Carent server to Users. The use of this technology greatly reduces the chance of third parties accessing and altering transmitted data in the case that it is intercepted. Even in the case that transmitted data is intercepted, the matching electronic key is necessary to decode the information. Although the number of electronic keys is limited, the identification of the correct electronic key would take a substantial amount of time and is therefore considered very difficult.",
